<p>This page will discuss dubstep, more specifically, an individual called Skrillex.</p>
<p>Sonny John Moore was born on January 15, 1988 and took up the DJ Name "Skrillex" around the early 2010s when the new type of music called "Dubstep" was peaking in popularity. Dubstep can be categorized as a harsher form of EDM (Electronic Dance Music) with a major focus on the insane beat drops. Skrillex himself, however, became popular with mainstream audiences due to his interesting look. Skrillex's iconic look - as you can see in the below image - is long hair with half of his head shaved bald accompanied by his black-framed glasses and facial piercings.</p>

<p>Although dubstep may have faded in popularity, the legacy left by Skrillex remains and its influence is shown in modern EDM to this day.</p>
